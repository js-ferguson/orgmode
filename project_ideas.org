PROJECT IDEAS -*- mode: org -*- 

* Build server
  - git server with ci autobuild and deploy to apache/nginx
  - local install of mariadb with a set of dummy data
  - provides a live development server site to the internal network to preview the latest build
  - running a btrfs for snapshots of the build directory

* Database
  - map the database to provide a visual chart of the db schema for easy reference
  - export database tables to create a dummy set locally development 

* Write comprehensive unit tests
  - Can't do any large scale refactoring and code modifications on an unfamilar codebase without
    some assurance that things will still work.
  - Helps to get to know the codebase

* Containerise the production environment
  - make it portable in case it some day makes sense to host somewhere else.
  - allows for orchestration via kubernetes to provide scalability.
